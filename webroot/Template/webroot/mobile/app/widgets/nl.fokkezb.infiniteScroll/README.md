# Alloy *Infinite Scroll* widget
The *Infinite Scroll* widget implements the design pattern also known as *Dynamic Scroll* or *Endless Scroll* for the [Alloy](http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#!/guide/Alloy_Quick_Start) MVC framework for [Titanium](http://www.appcelerator.com/platform) by [Appcelerator](http://www.appcelerator.com). A Titanium Classic implementation can be found in the [KitchenSink](https://github.com/appcelerator/KitchenSink/blob/master/Resources/ui/handheld/ios/baseui/table_view_dynamic_scroll.js).

Also take a look at my [Pull to Refresh](https://github.com/FokkeZB/nl.fokkezb.pullToRefresh) widget.

## Overview
The widget automatically shows an *ActivityIndicator* in a *TableView*'s *FooterView* when the user reached the end of the table. An event is triggered so that the implementing controller can load more rows.

## Features
* Add the widget to your *TableView* using just one line of code.
* Override all styling via your app's `app.tss`.
* Manually trigger the widget from your controller.

## Future work
* Full Android, Mobile Web, Tizen and BlackBerry compatibility and testing.
* Support for *ListView*s.

## Quick Start
* Download the latest [release](https://github.com/FokkeZB/nl.fokkezb.infiniteScroll/releases).
* Unzip the file to `app/widgets/nl.fokkezb.infiniteScroll`.
* Add the widget as a dependency to your `app/config.json` file:
	
	```javascript
		"dependencies": {
			"nl.fokkezb.infiniteScroll":"1.3.1"
		}
	```

* Add the widget to your *TableView*:

	```xml
	<TableView>
	  <Widget id="is" src="nl.fokkezb.infiniteScroll" onEnd="myLoader" />
	</TableView>
	```
	
* In the callback set via `myLoader` you call either `e.success()`, `e.error()` or `e.done()` optionally passing a custom message.

	```javascript
	function myLoader(e) {
		
		// Length before
		var ln = myCollection.models.length;
		
		myCollection.fetch({
		
			// Some data for the sync adapter to retrieve next "page"
			data: { offset: ln },
		
			// Don't reset the collection, but add to it
			add: true,
		
			// Don't trigger an "add" event for every model, but just one "fetch"
			silent: true,
			
			success: function (col) {
			
				// Call "done" if we didn't add anymore models
				(col.models.length === ln) ? e.done() : e.success();
			},
			
			error: e.error
		});
	}
	```
	
	Please note that in the example above I use `col.models.length` instead of `col.length`. There is a flaw in Backbone that will cause unpredictable lengths when more then 1 sync is performed at the same time.

## Styling
The widget can be fully styled without touching the widget source. Use the following ID's in your app's `app.tss` to override the default style:

| ID | Description |
| --------- | ------- |
| `#is` | The view to be added as *FooterView* |
| `#isCenter` | Can be used to align the content, but mainly to support iOS7's `Ti.UI.Window.extendEdges` by setting `bottom` to the height of the TabGroup (49). |
| `#isIndicator` | The *ActivityIndicator* showing during load |
| `#isText` | The message shown when not loading. Set `visible` to `false` if you want to hide the text until the first load has happened. |

## Options
There are no required options to pass via TSS properties or XML attributes, apart from the `onEnd` attribute to bind your callback to the end-event. You can change the displayed messages by using the following options:

| Parameter | Type | Default |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- |
| msgTap | `string` | Tap to load more... |
| msgDone | `string` | No more to load... |
| msgError | `string` | Tap to try again... |

## Methods
You can also manually trigger the loading state of the widget. You could use this for the first load when your window opens.

| Function   | Parameters | Usage |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----- |
| setOptions | `object`   | Set any of the options
| load       |            | Manually trigger the `end` event and loading state
| state      | `state`, `string`    | Manually set the state. The first argument should be one of the exported `SUCCESS`, `DONE` and `ERROR` constants. The second optional argument is a custom message to display instead of the message belonging to the state.
| dettach    |            | Manually set the `DONE` state and remove the scroll listener

## Changelog
* 1.3.1: 
  * Fixes scroll-load-state loop with fast syncs.
* 1.3:
  * Compatible with iOS7's new `Ti.UI.Window.extendEdges` via `#isCenter`.
  * Allows you to hide the text until first load by calling `show` after that
* 1.2:
  * Now compatible with Android (and other OS)
  * View will now always show since Android doesn't support removing it :(
* 1.1:
  * From now on declared in the XML view instead of the controller! 
  * Splitted `init` into `setOptions` and `attach`
  * Renamed `remove` to `dettach`
  * Renamed `trigger` to `load` to not interfere with BackBone 
* 1.0.1:
